                    <p><strong>WHAT ARE COOKIES AND LOCAL STORAGE?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Cookies are small text files placed on your browser or
                        device by websites, apps, online media, and
                        advertisements. There are different types of cookies.
                        Cookies served by the entity that operates the domain
                        you are visiting are called &quot;first party
                        cookies.&quot; So, cookies served by Phoenix while you
                        are on the Phoenix Platform are first-party cookies.
                        Cookies served by companies that are not operating the
                        domain you are visiting are called &quot;third party
                        cookies.&quot; For, e.g., we may allow Google to set a
                        cookie on your browser while you visit the Phoenix
                        Platform, and that would be a third-party cookie.
                        Cookies may also endure for different periods of time.
                        &quot;Session Cookies&quot; only last only if your
                        browser is open. These are deleted automatically once
                        you close your browser. Other cookies are
                        &quot;persistent cookies&quot;, meaning that they
                        survive after your browser is closed. For example, they
                        may recognize your device when you re-open your browser
                        and browse the internet again.

                        &quot;Pixel tags&quot; (also called beacons or pixels)
                        are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a
                        webpage, app, or advertisement which can retrieve
                        certain information about your device and browser,
                        including, for example, device type, operating system,
                        browser type and version, website visited, time of
                        visit, referring website, IP address, and other similar

                        that uniquely identifies the device. Pixels provide how
                        third parties can set and read browser cookies from a
                        domain that they do not themselves operate and collect
                        information about visitors to that domain, typically

                        Local storage is a technology that allows a website or
                        application to store information locally on your device.
                        &quot;Software Development Kits&quot; (also called SDKs)
                        function like pixels and cookies but operate in the
                        mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot
                        always function. The primary app developer can install
                        pieces of code (the SDK) from partners in the app,
                        thereby allowing the partner to collect certain
                        information about user interaction with the app and
                        information about the user device and network
                        information.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>WHY DO WE USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        We use cookies and other identification technologies for
                        various purposes, including authenticating users, store
                        information about you (including on your device or in
                        your browser cache) and your use of our Services and the
                        Phoenix Platform, remembering user preferences and
                        settings, determining the popularity of the content,
                        delivering and measuring the effectiveness of
                        advertising campaigns, analysing site traffic and
                        trends, and generally understanding the online
                        behaviours and interests of people who interact with our
                        Services.

                    <p><strong>WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        The types of cookies that may be used on our Website are
                        as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Authentication Cookies:</strong> These cookies
                        (including local storage and similar technologies) tell
                        us when you are logged in, so we can show you the
                        appropriate experience and features such as your account
                        information, order history, and edit your account
                        settings.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Security and site integrity cookies:</strong> We
                        use these cookies to support or enable security features
                        to help keep Phoenix safe and secure. For example, they
                        enable us to remember when you are logged into a secure
                        area of the Services and help protect your account from
                        being accessed by anyone other than you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Site features and Services:</strong> These
                        provide functionality that helps us deliver products and
                        Services. For example, cookies help you log in by
                        pre-filling fields. We may also use cookies and similar
                        technologies to help us provide you and others with
                        social plugins and other customized content and
                        experiences, such as making suggestions to you and
                        others.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Analytics and research:</strong> These are used
                        to understand, improve, and research products and
                        Services, including when you access the Phoenix website
                        and related websites and apps from a computer or mobile
                        device. For example, we may use cookies to understand
                        how you are using site features and segmenting audiences
                        for feature testing. Our partners and we may use these
                        technologies and the information we receive to improve
                        and understand how you use websites, apps, products,
                        services and ads.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Advertising:</strong> Things like cookies and
                        pixels are used to deliver relevant ads, track ad
                        campaign performance and efficiency. For example, our ad
                        partners and we may rely on information gleaned through
                        these cookies to serve you ads that may be interesting
                        to you on other websites. Similarly, our partners may
                        use a cookie, attribution service or another similar
                        technology to determine whether we’ve served an ad and
                        how it performed or provide us with information about
                        how you interact with them.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>HOW CAN I CONTROL COOKIES?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Most internet browsers are initially set up to
                        automatically accept cookies. You can change the
                        settings to block cookies or to alert you when cookies
                        are being sent to your device. There are several ways to
                        manage cookies. Please refer to your browser
                        instructions or help screen to learn more about
                        adjusting or modifying your browser settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you disable the cookies that we use, this may impact
                        your experience. At the same time, on the Phoenix
                        Platform, for example, you may not be able to visit
                        certain areas of the Phoenix Platform, or you may not
                        receive personalised information when you visit the
                        Phoenix Platform, or you may also be unable to login to
                        services or programs, such as logging into forums or
                        accounts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you use different devices to view and access the
                        Phoenix Platform (e.g. your computer, smartphone, tablet
                        etc.) you will need to ensure that each browser on each
                        device is adjusted to suit your cookie preferences.
